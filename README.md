***Why are you learning these skills?***

It is very likely I will be using Bash and/or Powershell (and maybe others) in future positions in IT and Cyber Security. From basic tasks to prebuilt scripts that can be automated to do whatever I need to accomplish at that time.

***What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?***

We learned how to navigate the command line terminal and different shells in Mac, Linux and Windows. These code challenges expand on that with learning more about how to create scripts for different systems and how they interact and function with thier own language and way of doing things.

***What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?***

What I have enjoyed the most is having fun with how I build them or change my code around to my personal style. Creating a function to take care of a repetitive task just for that specific assignment or tweaking how I fullfill

***How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?***

One of the things I did during a couple of the challenges was to create side scripts to automate deleting directories and/or folders. This could be done in the workplace as well. Instea of a code challenge, this could easily be tasks that someone has for a job. Having these script and/or this knowledge to create these script could help automate work. This could improve efficiency as well.

***What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?***

I have been and will keep working with and on these to clean them up and tweak them. I'm sure there will be more I'll learn and be able to combine with this work.

***What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?***

I'll keep growing and building on the basics, the more I practice and build, the better it gets. I hope to keep growing my own ability to create and see how I can keep using that for easy automation of tasks.
