# Purpose:                      Create a script that asks a user to type a domain, then displays information about the typed domain. Operations that must be used include:
  # whois
  # dig
  # host
  # nslookup

  # Install whois on your Ubuntu VM.

  # Add to your bash script a sixth option that calls a function to:
  
  # Take a user input string. Presumably the string is a domain name such as Google.com.
  # Run whois against a user input string.
  # Run dig against the user input string.
  # Run host against the user input string.
  # Run nslookup against the user input string.
  # Output the results to a single .txt file and open it with your favorite text editor.
