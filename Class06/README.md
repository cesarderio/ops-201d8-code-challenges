# Ops Challenge - Conditionals

## Overview

## Conditionals allow your script to test whether a situation is true and then proceed accordingly.

## Objectives
Create a script that detects if a file or directory exists, then creates it if it does not exist.
Your script must use at least one array, one loop, and one conditional.
